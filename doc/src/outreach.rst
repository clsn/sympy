SymPy logos
-----------

SymPy has a collection of official logos, which can
be generated from
`sympy.svg <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/doc/src/logo/sympy.svg>`_
in your local copy of SymPy by::

    $ cd doc
    $ make logo # will be stored in the _build/logo subdirectory

The license of all the logos is the same as SymPy: BSD. See the LICENSE file in
the trunk for more information.
